Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial. Every beginning programmer should understand these basic Data Structure topics:

-  [Queue](lessons/queue.md)
-  [Set](lessons/set.md)
-  [Binary Tree](lessons/binaryTree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
